## Training programme

### Materials

#### Programming

- [Intro to Python](https://github.com/nyjc-computing/intro-to-python)
  - complete all lessons (Advanced + Algorithms)
- [csv & json](training/csv-and-json.md)
- [html & css](training/html-and-css.md)

#### Security

- [Data validation and verification](training/data-validation-and-verification.md)
- [Unit testing](training/unit-testing.md)

#### Web

- [Web requests and responses](training/web-requests-and-responses.md)

#### Design

- [Programming Interfaces (APIs)](training/programming-interfaces-apis.md)

#### AI

**Note:** contributors are expected to write their own code, without the use of chatbots, although code completion assistants are allowed. This is part of the training to build up sufficient experience for collaborator-level contributions.

- [Chatbots](training/chatbots.md)
- [Code completion assistants](training/code-completion-assistants.md)

#### Lifecycle

- [Software versioning](training/software-versioning.md)

#### Communication

- [Docstrings and annotations](training/docstrings-and-annotations.md)

#### Collaboration

NYSD uses GitHub as the central place to manage project-related information.

- [Issues](training/artifact-issues.md) are used to track bug reports, requested features
- [Pull requests](training/artifact-pull-requests.md) are used to track work in progress and code merges
- [Project boards](training/artifact-project-boards.md) are used to track work allocation and feature progress
- [Project roadmaps](training/artifact-project-roadmaps.md) are used to track project progress, and see if the team is on target to meet milestones

#### Versioning

- [git branching](training/branching-in-git.md)

#### Process

- [code reviews](training/code-reviews.md)
